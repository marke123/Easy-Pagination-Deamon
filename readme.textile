h2. Easy Pagination Deamon

version: _v0.1.1_

* Gives you an easy pagination for ex. archives, search results, blog
 
----------------------------------------------------------------

h3. Example

When inserted it looks like the following:
First << 1 2 3 4 5 >> Last
_The "first"/"last"/"<<"/">>" only get's added if you're not on the first/last page_

h3. How-to

Simply add oxo_pagination(); to your template files.

You can specify a $range ex. oxo_pagination( 9 ); which would display
9 links to pages, where the current one is in the middle.
The default is "5". You should always use a not even number.

h3. Languages

It's prepared for a language file that translates "First" & "Last",
but so far you'd have to add that yourself.
